	<p><strong>Date last updated:</strong> March 19, 2014</p>
	<p><strong>PLEASE READ</strong> THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (THE &quotAGREEMENT&quot) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES OFFERED BY USERBALLOT, INC. (&quotUSERBALLOT&quot). YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON YOUR ASSENT TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS. BY CLICKING THE &quotSUBMIT&quot (OR SIMILAR) BUTTON, OR BY USING THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER (AS APPLICABLE) (I) YOU OR THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT (&quotCUSTOMER&quot) AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY AND A PARTY TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS, AND (II) YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO BIND CUSTOMER.</p>
	<p>1. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong>Access to Service.</strong> Subject to Customer&#39s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including payment of all applicable fees), UserBallot grants Customer the right to access and use the UserBallot services ordered by Customer (collectively, the &quotService,&quot or &quotServices&quot) during the Term (as defined below) for the internal business purposes of Customer, only as provided herein and only in accordance with UserBallot&#39s applicable user documentation. Customer&#39s use of the Services shall be subject to any additional limitations (e.g., maximum number of ballots or responses, platform restrictions, etc.) which are set forth on the Services or during the ordering process.</p>
	<p>2. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong>Modifications.</strong> UserBallot shall have the right (but not the obligation), at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Services (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice on the Services or by sending you an email. UserBallot may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>
	<p>3. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong>Support; Service Levels.</strong> UserBallot will: (i) provide Customer with 99% availability to the Service (the &quotService Availability&quot); (ii) use reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the security and integrity of the Service; and (iii) provide basic support to Customer. The Service Availability will be measured on a monthly basis, with all hours weighted equally, but the Service Availability measurement will exclude reasonable scheduled downtime for system maintenance as well as any downtime resulting from outages of third party connections or utilities or other reason beyond UserBallot&#39s control (including without limitation, acts of God, acts of government, flood, fire, earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labor problems (other than those involving UserBallot employees), computer, telecommunications, Internet service provider or hosting facility failures or delays involving hardware, software or power systems not within UserBallot&#39s possession or reasonable control, and denial of service attacks). If the Service is unavailable to Customer due to defects with the Service beyond the 99% monthly availability metric, then, as Customer&#39s sole and exclusive remedy (and UserBallot&#39s sole liability), UserBallot will provide Customer a credit for the subsequent Service billing cycle as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>
				<div>Availability</div>
			</th>
			<th>
				<div>Credit</div>
			</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<div>97.5% - 98.9%</div>

	</table>
	<p>In order to receive downtime credit, Customer must notify UserBallot within seventy-two (72) hours from the time of downtime, and failure to provide such notice will forfeit the right to receive downtime credit. All credits provided hereunder are nonrefundable. If Customer elects not to renew the Agreement, such that the above credit cannot be applied, Customer will have the option to receive up to one free month of Service as its sole remedy in lieu of such credit.</p>
	<p>4.  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong>Confidentiality; Ownership.</strong> Customer acknowledges that, in the course of using the Services and performing its duties under this Agreement, it may obtain, learn or develop information relating to the Services and/or to UserBallot or its suppliers or licensors (&quotProprietary Information&quot), including, but not limited to, code, technology, know-how, ideas, algorithms, testing procedures, structure, interfaces, specifications, documentation, bugs, problem reports, analysis and performance information, and other technical, business, product, marketing and financial information, plans and data. During and after the term of this Agreement, Customer shall hold in confidence and protect, and shall not use (except as expressly authorized by this Agreement) or disclose, Proprietary Information, unless such Proprietary Information becomes part of the public domain without breach of this Agreement by Customer, its officers, directors, employees or agents. Except for the rights expressly granted under this Agreement, as between the parties, UserBallot retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, and all other products, works, and other intellectual property created, used, or provided by UserBallot for the purposes of this Agreement. UserBallot shall be permitted to freely exploit all data generated by or on behalf of it in connection with the Services and to provide such data to third parties (including, without limitation, Customer Data (as defined below)), so long as such data is provided in the aggregate and can in no way be linked specifically to Customer. Customer shall, and hereby does, grant UserBallot a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate into the Service any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback provided by Customer or its users relating to the operation of the Service. Nothing in this Agreement will impair UserBallot&#39s right to develop, acquire, license, market, promote or distribute products, software or technologies that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with any products, software or technologies that Customer may develop, produce, market, or distribute.</p>
	<p>5.  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong>Fees.</strong> Customer shall pay UserBallot all fees applicable to the Services ordered by Customer, as set forth on the Services (&quotFees&quot) in accordance with the payment terms set forth on the Service. All Fees paid to UserBallot hereunder are nonrefundable. Any amounts payable hereunder are exclusive of all sales taxes, value added taxes, duties, use taxes, withholdings and other governmental assessments. Customer shall pay all such taxes and governmental assessments associated with the Services (excluding taxes based on UserBallot&#39s net income), unless Customer provides to UserBallot a valid tax-exempt certificate. UserBallot may change the Fees from time to time hereunder; provided that any change in Fees shall not go into effect until the commencement of the next Renewal Term (as defined below) that follows such notice.</p>
	<p>6.  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong>Restrictions.</strong> Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Customer shall not (and shall not permit any third party to), directly or indirectly: (i) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code, or underlying structure, ideas, or algorithms of the Service (except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction); (ii) modify, translate, or create derivative works based on the Service; (iii) copy, rent, lease, distribute, pledge, assign, or otherwise transfer or encumber rights to the Service; (iv) use the Service for the benefit of a third party; (v) remove or otherwise alter or obscure any proprietary notices or labels from the Service (including any associated links) or any portion thereof; (vi) block, disable, hide or limit in any way the ability of any device to access the Service or any portion or functionality of or enabled by the Service; (vii) use the Service to build an application or product that is competitive with any UserBallot product or service; or (viii) remove or export the Services or any Proprietary Information or any direct product thereof from the United States except in compliance with applicable law. Customer is responsible for all of Customer&#39s activity in connection with the Service, and Customer shall use the Service in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Customer shall not (and shall not permit any third party to), directly or indirectly, (a) take any action or (b) upload, download, post, submit or otherwise distribute or facilitate distribution of any material on or through the Service, that: (1) infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity or other right of any other person or entity; (2) is unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, deceptive, fraudulent, invasive of another&#39s privacy, tortious, obscene, offensive, or profane; (3) constitutes unauthorized or unsolicited advertising, junk or bulk e-mail (&quotspamming&quot); (4) contains software viruses or any other computer codes, files, or programs that are designed or intended to disrupt, damage, limit or interfere with the proper function of any software, hardware, or telecommunications equipment or to damage or obtain unauthorized access to any system, data, password or other information of UserBallot or any third party; or (5) impersonates any person or entity, including any employee or representative of UserBallot.</p>
	<p>7.  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong>Privacy and Customer Data.</strong> UserBallot&#39s current privacy policy is located <a href="/privacy/">here</a> and is incorporated into this Agreement by this reference (the &quotPrivacy Policy&quot). Customer understands that the Services may provide functionality which allows Customer to send data or information to UserBallot, which may include information provided by or relating to end users of Customer&#39s products and services (collectively, &quotCustomer Data&quot). Customer must not transfer to UserBallot, and must not (nor allow any third party to) modify, configure or use the Services to track, collect, or to cause to be collected by or transferred to UserBallot, any Customer Data that is personally identifiable information, financial information, health information, medical information, pharmaceutical information, information regarding children under 13 years of age, or other sensitive information (for example, Social Security Numbers), or that is used to target advertising to individual devices or end users. Customer shall be solely responsible for ensuring that Customer&#39s use of the Service, including without limitation Customer&#39s provision of Customer Data to UserBallot through Services, complies with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, industry self-regulatory regimes and third-party contracts, terms and policies, and for obtaining all consents, authorizations and clearances from Customer&#39s end users, third-party software application markets and any other third parties that may be required in connection therewith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer must maintain a privacy policy applicable to Customer&#39s products and services that (i) is prominently presented to users, (ii) fully discloses Customer&#39s use of the Service and the provision of Customer Data to UserBallot as contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) includes a link to UserBallot&#39s Privacy Policy (at the URL set forth above), and (iv) describes how end users may opt out of providing information to UserBallot by contacting UserBallot at info@userballot.com. Customer acknowledges and agrees that UserBallot is permitted to use Customer Data in accordance with UserBallot&#39s Privacy Policy. Customer represents, warrants and covenants to UserBallot that Customer has and shall maintain all rights as are required to permit the collection of Customer Data by UserBallot as contemplated by this Agreement, and to allow UserBallot to access, use, store, display, disclose, transfer and sell Customer Data pursuant to this Agreement. Additionally, Customer shall not interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service or any activities conducted on the Service, or bypass any measures UserBallot may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service (or other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to the Service).</p>
	<p>8.  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong> Disclaimer.</strong> EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED &quotAS IS&quot AND &quotAS AVAILABLE&quot AND ARE WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY ANY COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE OF TRADE, OR COURSE OF DEALING, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.</p>
	<p>9.  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong>Term; Termination.</strong> This Agreement shall commence upon Customer&#39s first use of the Services. If Customer has selected a free, trial, or evaluation subscription to the Services, this Agreement shall continue until the applicable free, trial, or evaluation period for the Services (as described on the Services) is terminated in accordance with this Section (the &quotFree Subscription&quot). In addition, if Customer orders and pays for a paid subscription to the Services, any existing Free Subscription shall terminate, and thereafter this Agreement shall continue for the applicable subscription period set forth on the Services during the ordering process (the &quotInitial Term&quot) unless earlier terminated in accordance herewith. For any Services which are subject to renewal, following the Initial Term, subject to Customer&#39s payment of all applicable fees, this Agreement may be renewed for successive renewal periods as set forth on the Services (each, a &quotRenewal Term&quot, and together with the term of any Free Subscription and the Initial Term, the &quotTerm&quot). If Customer terminates any paid subscription in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and UserBallot agrees to continue providing the Service to Customer on a free basis following such termination, such continued provision of Service shall be deemed a new Free Subscription. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, UserBallot&#39s obligations under Section 3 (&quotSupport; Service Levels&quot) of this Agreement shall not apply during any Free Subscription. If Customer is in material breach of any provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation Section 7), UserBallot reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services until such breach is materially cured. Without limiting the foregoing, either party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the event that such other party materially breaches this Agreement and does not materially cure such breach within thirty (30) days of such notice. In addition, (i) UserBallot may terminate this Agreement during any Free Subscription upon thirty (30) days&#39 written notice to Customer, and (ii) UserBallot may suspend Customer&#39s access to the Service or terminate this Agreement if Customer&#39s use of the Services places an unreasonable load on the Services or otherwise interferes with UserBallot&#39s ability to provide the Services to other customers (as determined by UserBallot in its reasonable discretion). Upon termination, the rights and licenses granted to Customer hereunder shall terminate and Customer shall immediately return anything Customer has obtained in connection with the Services, together with any and all documents, notes and other materials respecting the Services to UserBallot, including, without limitation, all Proprietary Information and all copies and extracts of the foregoing, but the terms of this Agreement will otherwise remain in effect. The Services may incorporate functions that render the Services inoperable after the termination or expiration of the Term.</p>
	<p>10. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> IN NO EVENT SHALL USERBALLOT, NOR ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS OR CONTENT PROVIDERS, BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES (HOWEVER ARISING), (II) FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE (REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF ORIGINATION), OR (III) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF (IN THE AGGREGATE) THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER TO USERBALLOT HEREUNDER IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO A CLAIM HEREUNDER. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO CUSTOMER.</p>
	<p>11. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> This Agreement represents the entire agreement between Customer and UserBallot with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between Customer and UserBallot with respect thereto. The Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California. In any action to enforce this Agreement the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys&#39 fees. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by Customer except with UserBallot&#39s prior written consent, and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing shall be void and without effect. UserBallot may freely assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder. The parties agree that the provisions of this Agreement are intended for the benefit of, and are enforceable solely by, the other party, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving any other person any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision hereof. Customer shall indemnify and hold harmless UserBallot from any and all claims, liabilities, damages and/or costs (including but not limited to, reasonable attorneys&#39 fees) arising in connection with (i) any breach of this Agreement by Customer, or (iii) Customer&#39s use of the Services. Customer acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of UserBallot&#39s Proprietary Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder, that any such breach may allow Customer or third parties to unfairly compete with UserBallot resulting in irreparable harm to UserBallot, and therefore, that upon any such breach or threat thereof, UserBallot shall be entitled to injunctions and other appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it may have at law (without the requirement of posting a bond). No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of this Agreement and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. The failure of UserBallot to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by Customer or others shall not constitute a waiver and shall not limit UserBallot&#39s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. All notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.</p>
