		<h1 style="margin-top: 100px;">Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> March 19, 2014</p>
		<p>We at UserBallot know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.  <strong>By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</strong></p>
		<p>Generally, there are two primary ways that you might use or access our Services:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>First, as a customer of UserBallot (&quotCustomer&quot), you may use our Services to create customized ballots, polls, and similar interactive features (&quotBallots&quot) which you may then place on your website, application or other service, as permitted by the Services (a &quotCustomer Site&quot).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Second, if you visit or use any Customer Sites offered by one or more of our Customers, then you may interact with our Services when you respond to, or otherwise interact with, the Ballots on those Customer Sites.  In that case, we refer to you in this Privacy Policy as an &quotEnd User&quot of a Customer Site.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Whether you are a Customer or an End User, we may gather Personal Information (as defined below) from you in connection with your use of our Services, all as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p>Remember that, if you are a Customer of UserBallot, your use of UserBallot&#39s Services is at all times subject to the <a href="/tos.php">Terms of Service</a>, which incorporates this Privacy Policy.  Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the <a href="/tos.php">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
		<h3><strong>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</strong></h3>
		<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (&quotPersonal Information&quot) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don&#39t own or control, or people that we don&#39t manage.</p>
		<p>We gather various types of Personal Information from you, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to provide and improve the Services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. </p>
		<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at info@userballot.com.</p>
		<h3><strong>Will UserBallot ever change this Privacy Policy?</strong></h3>
		<p>We&#39re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you&#39ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven&#39t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them.  If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.  Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p>
		<h3><strong>What Information does UserBallot Collect?</strong></h3>
		<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong></p>
		<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.  For example, if you are a Customer, then through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, Customer Site URL(s), and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (&quotThird Party Account Information&quot) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy.  Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.  In addition, if you are an End User, we collect any information that you provide in response to a Ballot, which may include Personal Information such as location, and device and/or browser information.</p>
		<p>We may communicate with you if you&#39ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you&#39ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers regarding our products or services, or email you about your use of the Services.  Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services.  If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by emailing info@userballot.com.  </p>
		<p><strong>Information Collected Automatically:</strong></p>
		<p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, &quotcookie&quot information, the type of browser and/or device you&#39re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. &quotCookies&quot are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.  You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device&#39s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.  If you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you.  Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren&#39t responsible for their privacy policies and practices.</p>
		<p>When we collect the usage information described above, we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  For example, this aggregate data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.  </p>
		<h3><strong>Will UserBallot Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</strong></h3>
		<p>We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we do share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p>
		<p><strong>Aggregated Personal Information that&#39s no longer personally identifiable. </strong></p>
		<p>We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.</p>
		<p><strong>Ballots:</strong></p>
		<p>If you are an End User, you understand and acknowledge that we may allow Customers  to choose the demographic information of End Users who will see their Ballots, and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to a Customer, in order for that Customer to select the appropriate audience for those Ballots. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you a Ballot that is tailored for End Users located in San Francisco, but we will not tell the Customer who created the Ballot who you are.</p>
		<p><strong>Affiliated Businesses:</strong></p>
		<p> In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we&#39re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business&#39 or websites&#39 policies.</p>
		<p><strong>Agents:</strong></p>
		<p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is reasonably necessary to assist us. </p>
		<p><strong>User Profiles and Submissions:</strong></p>
		<p>Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services.  Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others.  Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others.  Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments.</p>
		<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong></p>
		<p>We may choose to buy or sell assets.  In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred.  Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>
		<p><strong>Protection of UserBallot and Others:</strong></p>
		<p>We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of UserBallot, our employees, our users, or others.</p>
		<h3><strong>Is Personal Information about me secure?</strong></h3>
		<p>Your UserBallot account (if you&#39ve created one) is protected by a password for your privacy and security.  You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism, appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
		<p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
		<h3><strong>What Personal Information can I access?</strong></h3>
		<p>If you&#39ve created a UserBallot account, then through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you&#39ve provided to us:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Name and password</li>
			<li>Email address</li>
			<li>Customer site URL(s)</li>
			<li>User profile information</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change.  If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at info@userballot.com. </p>
		<p>Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.  If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to: info@userballot.com.</p>
		<h3><strong>What choices do I have?</strong></h3>
		<p>You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our special features.</p>
		<p>You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above.  When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.  You may request deletion of your account by contacting us at info@userballot.com.  Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>
		<h3><strong>What if I have questions about this policy?</strong></h3>
		<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to info@userballot.com, and we will try to resolve your concerns.</p>
